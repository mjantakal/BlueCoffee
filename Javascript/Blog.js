E-commerce made our life easier by providing products and services online. However, based on Schneider&amp;rsquo;s (2012) research the challenges faced by e-commerce are influenced by the culture between the countries and communities. Culture is the combination of language and habits of people in a certain region. The design and language used to display the information might not be effective on everyone, some set of people from different culture may find it difficult or may not understand the product provided by electronic commerce. Users around the world expecting for e-commerce products to be localized through which they can understand the product thoroughly. &amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=\'margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:\&quot;Times New Roman\&quot;,serif;line-height:200%;background:white;\'&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;color:black;\&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Culture is one of the important types of information people depending on while making decision. Language is one of the major barriers in the culture. Language changes across the borders and&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;color:black;\&quot;&gt;sometimes there are multiple languages spoken by people within a country. By publishing an e-commerce website in one language might not be affective and it might not cover the expected range. For example, China might not be able to understand the product description which is displayed in English on e-commerce website. Another cultural issue might be the usage of images, icons etc. Usage of some particular images such as symbol of OK in USA is inappropriate in other countries. &lt;span style=\&quot;background:white;\&quot;&gt;Businesses involved in E-commerce should carefully select icons used on their websites. For example, some countries would be confused with the words shopping cart as opposed to shopping baskets and trolleys. &amp;nbsp;Also, the use of signals and gestures should be properly researched.&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=\'margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:\&quot;Times New Roman\&quot;,serif;line-height:200%;\'&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Important is the for e-commerce should follow the step that are involved by the organizations while developing a website. Firstly, they should understand the culture of targeted audience of other countries to ensure what their business and avoid misunderstandings or avoid becoming offensive to the culture of any region. By this it is made sure that users are able to understand the content and comfortable using website to make purchases. The design of the website is another factor to be considered. One should be careful while choosing colors, icons and graphs, payment method and content. For an example, most of the e-commerce websites provide cash on delivery wherein in USA we don&amp;rsquo;t have that option. All these steps aid in the success of e-commerce website.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=\'margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:\&quot;Times New Roman\&quot;,serif;line-height:200%;\'&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In conclusion it is important to study and understand the culture of the country the website is going to be hosted. To avoid cultural issues on e-commerce following steps should be followed&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;ol style=\&quot;list-style-type: decimal;\&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;color:black;\&quot;&gt;By globalizing that is by providing the content in the local language in which buyer understand.&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;color:black;\&quot;&gt;By localization - &lt;span style=\&quot;background:white;\&quot;&gt;This is to ensure that, there evidence of cultural sensitivity in relating to theme of the appearance, interactivity, and content of the website&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=\&quot;color:black;background:white;\&quot;&gt;Finally, reduce text in images because the famous search engine does not translate images so good. The machine translation language does not work well in graphical images&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;';
